# Appendix C — Observational Case Studies

---

## Appendix Summary (Calibration)

**What this appendix provides:**
- Detailed observational support for selection framework
- Orion proplyd data and S calculations
- Nebular filament statistics
- Galactic persistence data
- Nuclear stability band observations
- Laboratory coherence systems

**What this appendix does NOT do:**
- Fit models to data
- Claim all observations are explained
- Use speculative interior physics

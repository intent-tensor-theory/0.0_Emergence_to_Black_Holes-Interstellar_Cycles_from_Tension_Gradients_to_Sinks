# Appendix E — Testable Predictions and Falsifiability

---

## Appendix Summary (Calibration)

**What this appendix provides:**
- What would falsify the framework (strong criteria)
- Quantitative predictions (testable)
- Laboratory-scale experimental hooks
- Astrophysical predictions
- Computational falsification criteria

**Why this matters:**
A theory that cannot fail is already wrong.

## E.8 Summary

| Prediction | Test Domain | Observable |
|------------|-------------|------------|
| S < 1 → failure | All scales | Correlation with dissolution |
| Failure dominates | Nebulae | Structure statistics |
| Selection sharpens | Simulations | Boundary contrast |
| Scale invariance | Cross-domain | Dimensionless S comparison |

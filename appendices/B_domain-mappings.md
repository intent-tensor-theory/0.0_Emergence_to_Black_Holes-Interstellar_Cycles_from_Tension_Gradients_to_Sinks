# Appendix B — Domain Mappings

## B.0 Purpose of Domain Mappings

This appendix maps the emergence framework onto established physics domains. The goal is to show how **existing formalism** relates to **emergence concepts**—not to replace existing physics, but to provide a unifying interpretation.

**Mapping is not equivalence.** When we say "phase ↔ scalar potential," we mean there is a structural correspondence, not that they are identical concepts.

## B.1 Quantum Mechanics

### B.1.1 The Wavefunction

**Standard QM**: The wavefunction ψ(x,t) is a complex-valued probability amplitude.

$$\psi = |\psi| e^{i\phi}$$

**Emergence mapping**:
- |ψ|² → Structure density (how much field configuration is present)
- φ → Scalar potential Φ (the pre-geometric tension field)

### B.1.2 Phase Gradient and Momentum

**Standard QM**: The momentum operator is:

$$\hat{p} = -i\hbar \nabla$$

Applied to ψ = |ψ|e^(iφ):

$$\vec{p} = \hbar \nabla \phi$$

**Emergence mapping**:
- ∇φ → ∇Φ (gradient, collapse vector)
- Momentum → Directional bias at 1D stage

The momentum of a quantum particle is the **phase gradient**—the 1D emergence structure.

### B.1.3 Superposition

**Standard QM**: A system can be in a superposition of states:

$$|\psi\rangle = \alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle$$

**Emergence mapping**:
- Superposition → Pre-closure coexistence
- The system has gradients and recursion but no closure
- Multiple configurations exist simultaneously because identity is not yet defined

### B.1.4 Measurement

**Standard QM**: Measurement "collapses" the wavefunction to an eigenstate.

**Emergence mapping**:
- Measurement → Forced closure
- Environmental interaction forces the 2D → 3D transition
- One configuration achieves closure; others are excluded

### B.1.5 Decoherence

**Standard QM**: Decoherence occurs when the system becomes entangled with the environment, destroying interference.

**Emergence mapping**:
- Decoherence → Recursive failure (Axis II collapse)
- Environmental coupling breaks phase loops
- The system falls from 2D back to 1D or 0D

### B.1.6 The Uncertainty Principle

**Standard QM**: Position and momentum cannot both be precisely known:

$$\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}$$

**Emergence mapping**:
- This reflects the trade-off between closure (position) and gradient (momentum)
- Strong closure (well-defined boundary) → weak gradient information
- Strong gradient (well-defined direction) → weak closure information

This is an ICHTB complementarity: Axes I and III are in tension.

### B.1.7 Summary Table

| QM Concept | Emergence Mapping |
|------------|-------------------|
| Wavefunction | Pre-closure field |
| Phase | Scalar potential Φ |
| Momentum | Phase gradient ∇φ |
| Superposition | Pre-closure coexistence |
| Measurement | Forced closure |
| Decoherence | Recursive failure |
| Uncertainty | Axis I / Axis III complementarity |

## B.2 Thermodynamics

### B.2.1 Entropy

**Standard thermo**: Entropy S measures disorder or the number of microstates.

$$S = k_B \ln \Omega$$

**Emergence mapping**:
- Entropy increase → Unregulated loss
- High entropy → Low structure density, S < 1
- The second law describes the **default outcome** (failure)

### B.2.2 Free Energy

**Standard thermo**: Free energy F = U - TS determines spontaneous processes.

**Emergence mapping**:
- Free energy → Retention capacity
- Minimizing F → Maximizing S (selection number)
- Stable states are **selection basins**

### B.2.3 Temperature

**Standard thermo**: Temperature measures average kinetic energy.

**Emergence mapping**:
- High temperature → High loss rate Ṙ
- Low temperature → Low loss rate Ṙ
- Cooling → Moving toward selection basins

### B.2.4 Phase Transitions

**Standard thermo**: Phase transitions occur at critical temperatures.

**Emergence mapping**:
- Phase transitions → Selection ridge crossings
- At the critical point, S ≈ 1
- The system transitions between ICHTB classes

### B.2.5 Summary Table

| Thermo Concept | Emergence Mapping |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Entropy | Unregulated loss measure |
| Free energy | Retention capacity |
| Temperature | Loss rate proxy |
| Phase transition | Selection ridge crossing |

## B.3 Electromagnetism

### B.3.1 Maxwell's Equations

**Standard EM**:

$$\nabla \cdot \vec{E} = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}$$
$$\nabla \cdot \vec{B} = 0$$
$$\nabla \times \vec{E} = -\frac{\partial \vec{B}}{\partial t}$$
$$\nabla \times \vec{B} = \mu_0 \vec{J} + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \vec{E}}{\partial t}$$

### B.3.2 Emergence Mapping

| Maxwell Equation | Emergence Interpretation |
|------------------|--------------------------|
| ∇·E = ρ/ε₀ | Charge as boundary curvature residue |
| ∇·B = 0 | Magnetic closure is always complete |
| ∇×E = -∂B/∂t | E-field curl from changing B (recursion coupling) |
| ∇×B = μ₀J + ... | B-field curl from current and changing E |

### B.3.3 Electromagnetic Waves

**Standard EM**: EM waves are self-propagating oscillations of E and B.

**Emergence mapping**:
- EM waves are **mature 2D structures**
- E and B mutually maintain each other's curl
- Propagation is recursion that moves through space
- Photons are **unclosed recursion**—they have curl but no boundary

### B.3.4 Charge

**Standard EM**: Charge is a fundamental property of particles.

**Emergence mapping**:
- Charge is the external footprint of boundary curvature
- Positive charge: ∇²Φ < 0 (source geometry)
- Negative charge: ∇²Φ > 0 (sink geometry)
- Charge conservation reflects boundary topology conservation

### B.3.5 Summary Table

| EM Concept | Emergence Mapping |
|------------|-------------------|
| Electric field E | Gradient structure |
| Magnetic field B | Curl structure |
| Charge | Boundary curvature residue |
| EM wave | Propagating recursion |

### B.4.3 Gravity as Gradient

In the weak-field limit:

$$g_{00} \approx -\left(1 + \frac{2\phi}{c^2}\right)$$

where φ is the Newtonian potential.

**Emergence mapping**:
- Gravitational potential → Scalar potential Φ
- Gravitational acceleration → Gradient ∇Φ
- Gravity is the **large-scale expression** of gradient structure

### B.4.4 Black Holes

**Standard GR**: A black hole is a region where spacetime curvature prevents escape.

**Emergence mapping**:
- Black hole = Class IV structure (extreme closure)
- Event horizon = Perfect boundary (nothing crosses outward)
- Interior = Beyond the framework's scope

### B.4.5 Cosmological Constant

**Standard GR**: The cosmological constant Λ represents vacuum energy.

**Emergence mapping**:
- Λ > 0 → Baseline loss rate in the CTS
- Expansion → Universal S < 1 trend at largest scales
- Dark energy → The CTS has nonzero "tension floor"

This mapping is speculative and requires further development.

- Information → Surviving distinctions

### B.8.2 Error Correction

**Standard info**: Error-correcting codes protect information from noise.

**Emergence mapping**:
- Error correction → Selection enhancement
- Redundancy → Multiple retention pathways
- Noise → Loss mechanism

## B.9 Mapping Limitations

These mappings have limitations:

1. **Not derivations**: We map concepts, not derive equations.
2. **Heuristic**: Some correspondences are suggestive, not rigorous.
3. **Incomplete**: Not all phenomena are covered.
4. **Non-unique**: Other mappings may be equally valid.

The mappings show **structural parallels** between the emergence framework and established physics. They do not prove the framework is correct—they show it is **consistent** with what we know.

---

## B.10 Summary

The emergence framework maps onto established physics at all scales:

| Domain | Key Mapping |
|--------|-------------|
| Quantum mechanics | Wavefunction as pre-closure field |
| Thermodynamics | Entropy as unregulated loss |
| Electromagnetism | Charge as boundary residue |
| General relativity | Curvature as Laplacian |
| Nuclear physics | SEMF as selection equation |
| Astrophysics | Stars/galaxies as selection basins |
| Condensed matter | Coherence as recursion |

These mappings do not replace existing physics. They provide a **unifying lens** through which diverse phenomena can be understood as expressions of the same underlying selection logic.

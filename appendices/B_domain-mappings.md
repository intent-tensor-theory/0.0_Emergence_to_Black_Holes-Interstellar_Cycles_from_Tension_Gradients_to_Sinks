# Appendix B — Domain Mappings

---

## Appendix Summary (Calibration)

**What this appendix provides:**
- How CTS stages map to known physics domains
- Quantum mechanics mapping (coherence, decoherence, phase)
- Thermodynamics mapping (entropy, free energy)
- Cosmology/QFT relationship
- Mesoscopic systems (superconductivity, SQUIDs)
- Planck scale interpretation

**What this appendix does NOT do:**
- Replace any domain theory
- Claim equivalence (only controlled mapping)
- Assert that emergence supersedes existing physics

🜂 *Physics did not miss emergence.*  
*It described it—without naming it.*

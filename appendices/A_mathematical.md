# Appendix A — Mathematical Formalism

---

## Appendix Summary (Calibration)

**What this appendix provides:**
- Explicit operator definitions
- Formal CTS stack summary
- Stability criteria derivations
- Selection functional properties
- Dimensional analysis
- Where standard math is reinterpreted vs used as-is

**What this appendix does NOT do:**
- Propose new mathematics
- Claim rigorous topology (that's noted as open)
- Replace existing formalisms

## A.9 Formal CTS Stack Summary

| Stage | Operator | Condition | Emergence Meaning |
|-------|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| 0D | Φ | variation permitted | undecided potential |
| 1D | ∇Φ | direction exists | bias / polarity |
| 2D | ∇×F | recursion | memory |
| 3D | ∇²Φ | closure | identity |
| 3D+ | S > 1 | regulated loss | persistence |

🜂 *Mathematics does not create emergence.*  
*It reveals where emergence is allowed.*

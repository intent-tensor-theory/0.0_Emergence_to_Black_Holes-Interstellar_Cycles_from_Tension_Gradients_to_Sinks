# Appendix D — Computational Methods

---

## Appendix Summary (Calibration)

**What this appendix provides:**
- How to simulate emergence without presupposing objects
- Minimal computational substrate (grid as permission space)
- Gradient, curl, closure operators on discrete grids
- Loss channel implementation
- Selection number calculation
- SEMF implementation details
- Emergence metrics and diagnostics

**What this appendix does NOT do:**
- Claim simulations are reality
- Predict specific constants
- Replace domain-specific codes

# Appendix F — Open Questions and Non-Claims

---

## Appendix Summary (Calibration)

**What this appendix provides:**
- Explicit boundaries of the framework
- Questions that remain genuinely open
- What would change the framework
- Non-claims about consciousness, biology, cosmology
- Mathematical refinements needed

**Why this exists:**
A framework that claims completeness is already finished—and therefore already wrong.

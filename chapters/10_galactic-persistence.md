# Chapter 10 — Galactic Persistence: Mature Emergence

---

## Chapter Summary (Calibration)

**What this chapter establishes:**
- Galaxies as large-scale persistence envelopes
- Disk geometry as curvature lock at astronomical scale
- Spiral arms as selection ridges (S ≈ 1 zones)
- Cosmic filaments feeding galaxies (same logic as nebular filaments)
- Feedback as regulation, not disruption
- The Milky Way as evidence that large-scale emergence stabilizes
- Quenched/starburst galaxies as regulation failures

**Key equations:**
- S_gal = M_gal / (Ṁ_loss · t_ref)
- Long-timescale selection (t_ref ~ 10⁹ years)

**What this chapter does NOT claim:**
- That galaxies are static or permanent
- That galactic dynamics are replaced
- That all galactic phenomena are explained

**Depends on:** Chapter 09 (nebular logic scales up)
**Required by:** Chapter 11 (black holes exist within galactic context)

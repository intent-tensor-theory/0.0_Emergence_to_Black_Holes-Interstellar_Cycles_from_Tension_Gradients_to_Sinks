# Chapter 12 — Synthesis: What Has Been Shown

---

## Chapter Summary (Calibration)

**What this chapter establishes:**
- Summary of the mechanical framework
- The central result: S = R/(Ṙ·t_ref) as universal persistence criterion
- Cross-scale coherence demonstrated
- What the framework explains vs what it does not
- Emergence without teleology
- How the framework can be tested

**What this chapter does NOT do:**
- Extend claims beyond evidence
- Close loops that weren't demonstrated
- Make cosmological assertions
- Declare completeness

**Depends on:** All previous chapters
**Required by:** Appendices (which formalize and extend)

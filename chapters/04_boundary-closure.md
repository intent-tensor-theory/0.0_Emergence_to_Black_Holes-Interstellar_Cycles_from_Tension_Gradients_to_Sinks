# Chapter 4 — Boundary Lock and the Emergence of Volume (3D)

---

## Chapter Summary (Calibration)

**What this chapter establishes:**
- The Laplacian ∇²Φ as the closure operator
- Boundary as locked memory (inside vs outside)
- Why closure is the first irreversible step
- Shell formation and retention mechanics
- Matter as "frozen recursion"
- Charge as boundary residue (external footprint of locked curvature)

**Key equations:**
- ∇²Φ ≠ 0 (curvature closure condition)
- ∫_Ω ∇²Φ dV > 0 (closed region criterion)
- ρ_q ∝ -∇²Φ (charge as boundary signature, optional mapping)

**What this chapter does NOT claim:**
- That closure is guaranteed
- That space exists independently of closure
- That charge is fundamental (it's derived)

**Depends on:** Chapter 03 (recursion must reinforce before closure can lock)
**Required by:** Chapter 05 (selection laws operate on closed structures)

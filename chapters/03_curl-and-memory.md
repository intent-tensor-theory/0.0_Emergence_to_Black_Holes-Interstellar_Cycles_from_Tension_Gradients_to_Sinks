# Chapter 3 — Curl, Memory, and Phase Recursion (2D)

---

## Chapter Summary (Calibration)

**What this chapter establishes:**
- The curl operator ∇×F as the signature of recursion
- Curl as memory, not rotation (no space yet)
- Phase loops as self-reference without objects
- Why recursion is the first victory against loss
- Filaments as phase-stabilized structures
- Decoherence as recursive failure (not randomness)

**Key equations:**
- ∇×F⃗ ≠ 0 (recursion condition)
- R[Φ] = ∮ F⃗·dℓ⃗ (recursion functional)
- Phase loop closure integral

**What this chapter does NOT claim:**
- That rotation or angular momentum exist yet
- That time has been defined
- That objects carry memory

**Depends on:** Chapter 02 (gradients must exist to curl)
**Required by:** Chapter 04 (closure requires recursive reinforcement)

*It is repetition that survives noise.*

# Chapter 5 — Selection Laws

---

## Chapter Summary (Calibration)

**What this chapter establishes:**
- The selection number S = R/(Ṙ·t_ref) as the universal persistence criterion
- Why selection is unavoidable once boundaries exist
- Selection as a field S(x,t), not just a scalar
- Selection basins, ridges, and failure valleys
- Timescale choice as a "what counts as existing" knob
- Why failure is the default outcome

**Key equations:**
- S ≡ R / (Ṙ · t_ref)  — dimensionless selection number
- S > 1: persistence allowed
- S ≈ 1: marginal survival
- S < 1: failure inevitable
- B = {x | S(x,t) ≥ 1}  — selection basin definition

**What this chapter does NOT claim:**
- That selection has purpose or direction
- That S > 1 guarantees permanent existence
- That selection replaces thermodynamics

**Depends on:** Chapter 04 (boundaries must exist to be selected)
**Required by:** Chapters 06-12 (all applications use selection framework)

*It merely outlasts its losses.*

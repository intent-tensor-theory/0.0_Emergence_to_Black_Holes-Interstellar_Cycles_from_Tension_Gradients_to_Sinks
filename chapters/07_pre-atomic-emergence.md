# Chapter 7 — Pre-Atomic Emergence: Below the Atom

---

## Chapter Summary (Calibration)

**What this chapter establishes:**
- "Pre-atomic" means pre-identity, not miniature matter
- Matter requires eligibility: persistence, boundary, memory, regulated loss
- Why "particles" are a late description (labels for locked shells)
- Gradients exist before objects
- Why the Planck scale is a measurement limit, not emergence origin
- Quantum coherence as 1D-2D emergence; decoherence as recursive failure

**Key distinction:**
- Formation is common; persistence is rare
- Pre-atomic ≠ smaller atoms
- Pre-atomic = matter has not yet qualified

**What this chapter does NOT claim:**
- New particles or forces
- That quantum mechanics is wrong
- That Planck units are irrelevant

**Depends on:** Chapters 01-06 (the full CTS progression and selection framework)
**Required by:** Chapter 08 (atomic emergence builds on pre-atomic mechanics)

*It must first survive being almost nothing.*

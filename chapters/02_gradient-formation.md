# Chapter 2 — Gradient Formation and the Birth of Direction (1D)

---

## Chapter Summary (Calibration)

**What this chapter establishes:**
- The gradient operator ∇Φ as the first directional structure
- Direction without distance or motion
- Polarity as relational asymmetry (+∇Φ vs -∇Φ)
- Why gradients are inevitable given non-uniform Φ
- Filaments as the default success mode of early emergence

**Key equations:**
- F⃗ = ∇Φ (first collapse vector)
- Polarity dyad: expansion (+∇Φ) vs collapse (-∇Φ) orientation

**What this chapter does NOT claim:**
- That gradients imply forces
- That motion exists at this stage
- That space has been constructed

**Depends on:** Chapter 01 (scalar variation, CTS)
**Required by:** Chapter 03 (curl requires gradients to exist first)

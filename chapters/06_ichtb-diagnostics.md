# Chapter 6 — The ICHTB Diagnostic Framework

---

## Chapter Summary (Calibration)

**What this chapter establishes:**
- The Inverse Cartesian–Heisenberg Tensor Box (ICHTB) as diagnostic geometry
- Six constraint planes (paired axes)
- Why diagnosis works backward from structure to constraints
- Emergence classes: filaments, loops, shells, sinks, failures
- Why Cartesian intuition fails for emergence
- ICHTB as a map, not a model

**Key structure:**
| Axis | Plane A (Constraint) | Plane B (Loss) |
|------|---------------------|----------------|
| I: Directional | Gradient coherence | Gradient disruption |
| II: Recursive | Curl-supported memory | Loop failure |
| III: Boundary | Curvature lock | Boundary leakage |

**What this chapter does NOT claim:**
- That ICHTB predicts dynamics
- That emergence classes are discrete (they're continuous)
- That all systems fit cleanly into one class

**Depends on:** Chapter 05 (selection provides the organizing principle)
**Required by:** Chapters 09-11 (case studies use ICHTB placement)

## 6.7 Summary

| Class | Gradient | Recursion | Closure | Typical Examples |
|-------|----------|-----------|---------|------------------|
| I | Strong | Partial | Weak | Filaments, jets |
| II | Moderate | Strong | Partial | Vortices, envelopes |
| III | Strong | Strong | Strong | Atoms, stars, disks |
| IV | Extreme | Suppressed | Over-locked | Compact remnants |
| V | Weak | Weak | None | Noise, diffuse gas |

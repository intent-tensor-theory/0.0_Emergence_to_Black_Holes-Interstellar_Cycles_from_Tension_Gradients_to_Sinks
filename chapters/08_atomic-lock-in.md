# Chapter 8 — Atomic Lock-In: The Periodic Table as Survival Chart

---

## Chapter Summary (Calibration)

**What this chapter establishes:**
- Atoms as successful closure events, not primitives
- Sub-atomic entities (electron, proton, neutron) as lock roles, not ingredients
- Atoms emerge inside→out via nested locking (not assembly)
- The SEMF as a retention-vs-loss accounting system
- Stability band derivation from selection mechanics
- The periodic table as a catalog of persistence solutions
- Why most possible atoms never appear (selection failure)

**Key equations:**
- B(A,Z) = a_v·A - a_s·A^(2/3) - a_c·Z²/A^(1/3) - a_a·(A-2Z)²/A + δ(A,Z)
- Z*(A) = 2a_a·A / (4a_a + a_c·A^(2/3))  — beta-stability ridge
- |Z - Z*(A)| ≤ √(2Δ/κ(A))  — band half-width
- S_n > 0, S_p > 0  — drip line conditions
- S_{Z,N}(τ_min) = B(Z,N)/(ℏ/τ_min)  — nuclear selection number

**What this chapter does NOT claim:**
- That SEMF is derived from first principles here
- That nuclear physics is replaced
- That all nuclear behavior is explained

**Depends on:** Chapter 07 (pre-atomic mechanics explain what atoms lock)
**Required by:** Chapters 09-11 (atomic stability enables astrophysical emergence)

## 8.9 Summary

| SEMF Term | ITT Interpretation |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Volume (a_v·A) | Retention capacity |
| Surface (a_s·A^(2/3)) | Boundary leakage |
| Coulomb (a_c·Z²/A^(1/3)) | Over-centralization stress |
| Asymmetry (a_a·(A-2Z)²/A) | Shell incompatibility |
| Pairing (δ) | Micro-lock resonance |

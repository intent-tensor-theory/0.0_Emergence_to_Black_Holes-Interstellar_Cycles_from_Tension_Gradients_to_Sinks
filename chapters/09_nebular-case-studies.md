# Chapter 9 — Nebular Case Studies: Selection in Action

---

## Chapter Summary (Calibration)

**What this chapter establishes:**
- Nebulae as spatially extended selection fields S(x)
- Orion as a natural experiment in selection
- Proplyds as marginal shells (S ≈ 1)
- Filaments as selection channels (pre-closure)
- Turbulence as selection acceleration, not chaos
- Failure as diagnostic data
- Star-forming cores as selection basins

**Key observables:**
- Disk mass M_disk
- Photoevaporation rate Ṁ_loss
- Distance from ionizing sources
- S_Orion = M_disk / (Ṁ_loss · t_ref)

**What this chapter does NOT claim:**
- That all nebular physics is explained
- That turbulence is irrelevant
- That star formation is deterministic

**Depends on:** Chapters 05-06 (selection framework and ICHTB)
**Required by:** Chapter 10 (galactic persistence extends nebular logic)

## 9.8 Summary

| System | ICHTB Class | S Range | Outcome |
|--------|-------------|---------|---------|
| Filaments | I | ~1 locally | Selection channels |
| Proplyds (inner) | III marginal | <1 | Failure |
| Proplyds (outer) | III | >1 | Survival |
| Dense cores | III basin | >>1 | Stars |

🜂 *Where failure is visible everywhere,*  
*emergence is easiest to study.*

# Chapter 11 — Collapse Boundaries: Black Holes as Selection Sinks

---

## Chapter Summary (Calibration)

**What this chapter establishes:**
- Collapse-dominated regimes as boundary conditions, not origins
- Extreme curvature and constraint saturation
- Objects vs sinks: compositional vs environmental roles
- Why collapse regimes are stable (but halt emergence)
- Feedback without internal emergence
- Black holes as limits within emergence grammar

**Critical restraint (what we do NOT claim):**
- That black holes "feed" emergence
- That collapse "resets" creation
- That there is a cosmic cycle with purpose
- That interior physics is explained
- That information paradoxes are resolved

**Depends on:** Chapter 10 (collapse exists within galactic/cosmic context)
**Required by:** Chapter 12 (synthesis must acknowledge this boundary)
